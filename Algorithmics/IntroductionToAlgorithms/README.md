# Introduction to Algorithms

This part of the repos contains notes and exercises of the book "Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.

Due to the simplicity of some exercises and the time it would take to write corrections for all the exercises I choose to only write the ones that I find the most relevant.
